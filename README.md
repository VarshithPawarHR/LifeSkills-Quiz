# LS Quiz
## ðŸ™Œ Credits

This project is built with inspiration from existing quiz implementations and would not have been possible without the contributions and ideas shared by the following developers + I was bored :

- [**Varun Pai**](https://github.com/varunpai314)  
- [**Karthik S Salian**](https://github.com/Karthik-S-Salian)

Their work related to quiz structures, logic handling, and the overall approach to interactive question-based applications helped shape the foundation of this Life Skills Quiz.
